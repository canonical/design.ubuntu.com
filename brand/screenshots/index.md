    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>When producing materials for end-users, try to include a screenshot of the “whole machine experience”, i.e. a screenshot of the feature you have in mind displayed on a real laptop or other screen. You can reinforce that with more detailed shots of the specific feature.</p>
    <p>For developers, you should remove as much of the non-relevant content from the screenshot as possible, including (for example) window decoration and wallpapers, to focus attention on the specific element being discussed.</p>

    <h3>Screenshot styling for end users</h3>

    <p>For End Users show a feature screen shot in-situ supported by multiple standard screenshots in order to aid understanding of the software.</p>

    <h3>Screenshots for a mix of end users and developers</h3>
    <p>Use strategic standard screenshots to support your message.</p>

    <h3>Screenshots for developers</h3>
    <p>Use screenshots that show detail relevant to your copy. The developer audience is more interested in content and functionality, rather than the user interface styling.</p>
